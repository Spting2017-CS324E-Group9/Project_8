Dennis was whole responsible for part 1 of this assignment. Dennis made a interactive bar graph that displays data on diamonds. By pressing different keys, the user is able to view different y-axes. The x-axis displays whether the diamond cut is Fair, Good, Very Good, Ideal, or Premium. The y-axis shows the average value of Price, Carat, and Depth, based on the cut of the diamond on the x-axis.  In addition, he assisted Chris with part 3 by fixing the text wrapping in the description of the articles and assembling the radio buttons. 

Jacob was whole responsible for part 2 of this assignment. He created a crosstab which takes a user inputed carat range and displays the average price of diamonds that fit into every CUT/COLOR combination. 

Chris was largely responsible for part 3 of this assignment. They implemented the feed connection, XML data reading, hyperlinking, scrolling, previous/next capabilities, and header, footer, feed entry and settings (radio buttons) display. One bug that was left unfixed for time reasons is that scrolling continues even as the feed entries move above or below the display area.
